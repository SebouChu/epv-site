        <p>On 12 December 2023, the EPV label diplomas were officially awarded at the Nantes Prefecture. It was an opportunity to receive a gift before Christmas, to mark the end of the year but also to meet the newly labelled companies and prepare for 2024!<br><br>This celebration marked the end of the year by rewarding exceptional companies that have distinguished themselves through their know-how, by awarding them the diploma symbolising their integration into the EPV community or the renewal of their status for a period of five years.<br><br>Each area of the region has its own specific characteristics when it comes to skills of excellence: the Val de Loire for stonework and architecture, the Choletais for fashion and textiles, as well as in the fields of graphic arts or popular traditions...<br><br>Thank you to everyone who took part in this event, and we look forward to seeing you in 2024 to take part in various projects!</p>
