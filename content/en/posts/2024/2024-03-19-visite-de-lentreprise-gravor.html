        <p>On Tuesday 19 March 2024, the Réseau Excellence Pays de la Loire association had the opportunity to discover the expertise of <a href="https://www.gravor.com/en/" target="_blank">Grav'Or</a>, a company that has specialised in custom-made glass since 1982. It was also an opportunity to talk about the EPV label and to hold the association's General Meeting.<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelle-ratiskol-251840116/" target="_blank">Isabelle Ratiskol</a> took us on a tour of <a href="https://www.gravor.com/en/" target="_blank">Grav'Or</a>'s glassmaking facilities, where we observed the results of each stage of production, from cutting to the different techniques used to meet the requirements of each customer.<br><br>We then had the pleasure of holding the Annual General Meeting, at which we discussed the Association's activities in 2023, both financial and moral, as well as current and future initiatives for 2024.<br><br>Finally, in a friendly atmosphere, we talked about the EPV label, to help Grav'Or prepare its application. <br></p>
