  There are 40 of them, their names are Voilerie Phocéenne, Malongo, Verrerie de Biot, Calissons du Roy René, and what they all have in common is that they have been awarded the EPV label, three letters standing for Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant, companies that perpetuate ancestral and often artisanal know-how.

        <p><i>"These are specific skills and trades, since the EPV label, a State label, promotes rare or exceptional skills,"</i> explains Guillaume Fiévet, who chairs the association, which was set up almost 18 months ago in the South of France. <i>"They are often heritage products or more technical products. </i><i>Although they vary greatly in size - from very small companies to large SMEs - these 40 EPVs have one thing in common: they defend and pass on an expertise that could disappear because, </i>as Guillaume Fiévet points out, <i>there are often no schools to train these rare trades, which only continue to exist thanks to in-house transmission. </i><i>The question of transmission is essential. We're all SMEs, we manufacture locally, we don't relocate. At Savonnerie du Midi, for example, we train new master soapmakers, because there is no school for that. It takes one or two years to train a new master soap-maker before he or she is autonomous. The question of transmission and the ability to spot talent within the younger generation is really an important aspect of our communication",</i> stresses the president, who also explains that showing the general public what a living heritage company is does much to attract these local nuggets.</p><p><a href="https://region-sud.latribune.fr/economie/2023-01-27/le-label-entreprise-du-patrimoine-vivant-incite-a-ne-pas-opposer-innovation-et-tradition-guillaume-fievet-la-savonnerie-du-midi-949685.html">Source</a></p>
