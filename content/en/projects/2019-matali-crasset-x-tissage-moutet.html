        <p>To celebrate its 100th anniversary, Basque weaver Atelier Moutet decided to develop an anniversary collection with Matali Crasset. </p><p>Matali Crasset travels through worlds that are, to say the least, eclectic. From crafts to electronic music; from the textile industry to fair trade; from scenography to furniture; from graphic design to architecture... the industrial designer (by training) has established herself as a great creator, who loves to break the codes that govern our daily lives. </p><p>I wanted to preserve this Basque strength by adding a vibrancy to it," she explains. It's not just an everyday product or a decorative element. The company is on a human scale. It has values and conveys beautiful messages: authenticity, the relationship with nature, the environment... it gives us the opportunity, through domestic rituals, to affirm things," concludes Matali.</p>
