<p> Molinelli Métallerie d'Art is recognized for its unique know-how: it works on numerous large-scale projects such as the Jardin des Plantes in Montpellier or the Parc de la Tête d'Or in Lyon. Drawing on the skills of the journeymen and young people in training who make up the company, it works on two axes: traditional ironwork linked to heritage and contemporary metalwork, more focused on design.  <br></p>
