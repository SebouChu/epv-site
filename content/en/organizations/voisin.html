<p>As far back as 120 years ago, Léon Voisin, entrepreneur and adventurer, travelled the world in search of the finest cocoa.Now at the head of France's largest family-run chocolate factory, the 3rd and 4th generations of Voisin management are still driven by the same passion: to help you discover the world's chocolate nuggets.We defend the flavours of good chocolate, a real alternative to the standardization of taste, and we are proud today of this heritage, this anchoring in Lyon's gastronomic heritage.  </p>
