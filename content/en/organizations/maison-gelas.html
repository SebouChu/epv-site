<p>Maison Gélas, a family institution created in 1865, produces Armagnac from the Gers terroirs. Philippe Gelas, fourth generation of operator, perpetuates the innovative spirit of his ancestors by offering single-varietal Armagnacs. These exceptional beverages are marketed in France and abroad. It locally negotiates more than 2000 references of wines and spirits, intended for a clientele of individuals and catering professionals.  <br></p>
