<p>Since 1895, this family-run and independent paper mill has specialised in the design and production of tissue paper (packaging, protection) and technical interlayer paper (clothing, metallurgy, food processing). The know-how lies in the use of virgin and recycled raw materials, the colouring of the papers, their printing to make them a communication medium and the custom shaping into reels, rolls or formats.</p>
