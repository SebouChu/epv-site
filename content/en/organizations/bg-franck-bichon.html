<p>When details make the difference</p><p>Founded in 1985, BG is an artisanal, family-run business. It is constantly evolving, thanks to the passion of its creator Franck Bichon, his know-how, that of his suppliers specialized in top-of-the-range products, and the presence of skilled workers in sewing and manufacturing.  <br></p>
