        <p>ARSEN, created in 2017 with the support of the Normandy Region, aims to bring together, on a regional scale, companies united by their expertise. From a wide range of sectors (construction, textiles, beauty, luxury, industry, agri-food, decoration...), these are linked to a territory or have a direct relationship with the history of the Region. We don't know it enough, but our Normandy companies are known the world over for their expertise. Today, the association has 45 member companies, 2/3 of which have the EPV (Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant - Living Heritage Company) label, and is chaired by Luc Lesénécal (Chairman of Tricots Saint James).<br></p>

        <p>ARSEN aims to create an industry of excellence in Normandy. The association's mission is to promote Normandy products, develop sales in France and abroad, pass on know-how and seek innovation. The aim is to create a network of exchanges and support between Normandy companies holding the state label "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" (EPV) and Normandy companies with excellent know-how. The aim of the Normandy Region is to train young people and raise their awareness of the skills and expertise of these companies. This is why ARSEN is part of a global approach to attractiveness by developing know-how and business opportunities for its members.<br></p><ul>  </ul>
