        There are just 1,400 EPV-labeled companies in France, including around 100 in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region. Why are they so exceptional? Who are the teams who work there? They are founders, cabinetmakers, pastry chefs or button makers, and they work in an EPV entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant. This French label recognizes their exceptional know-how.<br>Reporting: Catherine Eme-Ziri / Fabienne Lemoing / Thomas Hardy / Karl Monnin / Pierre Corne
