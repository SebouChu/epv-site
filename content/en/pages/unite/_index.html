        <p>CSR</p>

      notes: >-
        <p>In essence, our companies are structures that value people and are deeply committed to promoting and preserving our country's living heritage. We firmly believe that our companies have an essential role to play in enhancing the sustainable development of our territories.</p><p>The corporate social responsibility dynamic is felt in every one of our companies. Some have expressed the need for support in structuring their information and deepening their commitment, while those who are most advanced in the field will be able to share their expertise. This is the background to the project proposed by INMA and ANEPV as part of the France 2030 "Green Alternatives 2" call for projects.</p><p>This project will enable EPV companies from all regions and sectors to share their best practices on a single platform, and to assess their progress using a scale of criteria specific to their business. We will be able to qualify and quantify CSR developments for EPV companies, and help smaller structures to join this common dynamic.</p>
