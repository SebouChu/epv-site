        <p>Know-how tourism meets expectations for a more sustainable form of tourism, anchored in local areas, promoting know-how, with economic spin-offs for businesses, and constituting for them a tool for attracting trades and recruitment. Know-how tourism is a French speciality, with 20 million visitors by 2022, and a growing number of businesses open to the public: 2,000 in 2019 and 3,500 by 2022. (Source: DGE)<br></p>
